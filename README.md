# Deepwork Timer
Simple timer script to track effectiveness of my work sessions. Since I work primarily on a computer, this is a way I am experimenting with the idea of deep work.

This works on windows only.

# What can you do with it?
- Create a task with a objective and durations (minutes)
    - If the timer expires it will notify you
    - You can choose to repeate the previous task with a different duration or create a new task, if the timer expires or if you quite the previous task

- When the timer is running
    - `p` to pause the timer
    - `r` to resume the timer
    - `d` to track instances where your mind wondered off
    - `q` to quite the current task

# Install
This is really dumb now.

* First do this
```pip install -r requirments.txt```

* Then this
```python timer.py -i```

* Then run the `timer.py` file
