# Deepwork Timer
Simple timer script to track effectiveness of my work sessions. Since I work primarily on a computer, this is a way I am experimenting with the idea of deep work. The idea is to log as much imformation as possible without disturbing the flow of work.

This works on windows only.

# What can you do with it?
- Create a task with a objective and durations (minutes)
    - If the timer expires it will notify you
    - You can choose to repeate the previous task with a different duration or create a new task, if the timer expires or if you quite the previous task


# Commands
The following are global hot keys to control the timer

- ```ctrl + alt + 0``` to pause/resume timer 
- ```ctrl + alt + 9``` to register distraction
- ```ctrl + alt + 1``` to stop timer 

# Install
This is really dumb now.

* First do this
```pip install -r requirments.txt```

* Then this
```python timer.py -i```

* Then run the `timer.py` file



# Ides to impliment
- To find minutes yeild per hour
    - How much focused time do I yield every hour that I work
- Context switch panelty detection
    - When switching back and forth between two different cognitively demanding task, you pay a penalty in the form of congnitive stress or lack focus. The goal is to find ways to minimize context switch penalty. So I will try to SOMEHOW detect when I am paying a high price.
